## Overview

## AugSelf-BigGAN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100

Please refer to the [augself-biggan](https://github.com/liang-hou/augself-gan/tree/main/augself-biggan) README to run *AugSelf-BigGAN* for conditional generation on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

## AugSelf-StyleGAN2 on FFHQ, LSUN-Cat, and five low-shot datasets

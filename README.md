## Overview

## AugSelf-BigGAN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100

Please refer to the [augself-biggan-cifar](https://github.com/liang-hou/augself-gan/tree/main/augself-biggan) README to run *AugSelf-BigGAN* for conditional generation on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

## AugSelf-StyleGAN2 on Low-shot datasets and FFHQ

Please refer to the [augself-stylegan2-pytorch](https://github.com/liang-hou/augself-gan/tree/main/augself-stylegan2) README to run *AugSelf-StyleGAN2* for unconditional generation on low-shot datasets and FFHQ.
